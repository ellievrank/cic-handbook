## What is Criminal Injuries Compensation?

Criminal Injuries Compensation is a payment that may be available if you were harmed because of a crime that happened in Western Australia.

The scheme is run by the **Office of Criminal Injuries Compensation (OCIC)**.

You may still be able to apply even if:

- the offender was never identified
- the offender was not charged
- the offender was found not guilty

:::note
Compensation is assessed individually. It is **not automatic**.
:::

## Who can apply?

### Victims of crime

You may be able to apply if you were injured because of a criminal offence. "Injury" can include:

- physical injury
- psychological or mental harm
- pregnancy resulting from an offence

### Close relatives

A close relative may be able to apply if the victim died as a result of the offence, or if they suffered psychological harm because of what happened to the victim.

:::danger
**Brothers and sisters are NOT considered close relatives under the scheme.**
:::

## What can compensation cover?

Compensation may include payment for:

- medical or psychological treatment
- the cost of medical or specialist reports
- loss of income while injured
- travel costs for treatment
- funeral expenses (for eligible close relatives)

## Do I need to report the crime to police?

**In most cases, yes.**

You are expected to report the offence to police as soon as reasonably possible. When reporting, it helps to keep the **police report number** and the **name of the officer**.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if I didn’t report the offence?</strong>
  </summary>
  If you did not report the offence, you may still be able to apply, but you will
  usually need a strong reason (e.g., fear, trauma). **Legal advice is strongly recommended.**
</details>

## Time limits (very important)

In most cases, you must apply within **3 years** of the date of the offence.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Can the time limit be extended?</strong>
  </summary>
  Yes, sometimes. An extension may be granted for good reasons (e.g., childhood abuse,
  mental health impacts).
</details>

## When should I apply?

It is usually best to apply after your injuries have stabilised. If the time limit is approaching:

1. Submit the application before the deadline.
2. Include a short letter explaining that your injuries are not yet settled.

## How do I apply?

You apply by completing the appropriate application form. There are **two different forms**.

<ApplyGrid />

## Writing your statement

Your statement explains:

- what happened
- how you were injured
- how your life has been affected

There is no required format. **Clear and honest is enough.**

## Can I get money before a final decision?

In some cases, you may be able to request an **interim payment** for treatment or funeral expenses.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Important things to know about interim payments</strong>
  </summary>
  * Interim payments are part of the final compensation amount. * If your claim is
  refused, the interim payment may need to be repaid.
</details>

## Will the offender be told?

**Usually, yes.**
The offender may receive an edited copy of your application. They will **not** be given your address.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if I’m worried about my safety?</strong>
  </summary>
  You can ask the Assessor not to recover compensation from the offender by explaining
  your safety concerns in writing.
</details>

## Getting help

Legal advice is recommended if:

- the offence was not reported
- you are outside the time limit
- you suffered psychological injury
- your claim is refused or reduced
