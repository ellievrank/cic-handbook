It explains, in plain language, who may be eligible to apply, what compensation can cover, and where to find support during the process. The aim is to reduce confusion and help people know what questions to ask next.

This handbook does not provide legal advice. Every situation is different, and the information here may not apply to all circumstances. If you are unsure about your eligibility or rights, it is strongly recommended that you speak with a lawyer or a community legal service.

The content in this handbook has been informed by publicly available guidance from courts, government agencies, and community legal organisations. A list of resources consulted is available in the Acknowledgements section.

## What is Criminal Injuries Compensation?

Criminal Injuries Compensation is a payment that may be available if you were harmed because of a crime that happened in Western Australia.
Victims of crime who have suffered an injury can apply for compensation under the _Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 2003_ (WA).
The scheme is run by the **Office of Criminal Injuries Compensation (OCIC)**.

You may still be able to apply even if:

- the offender was never identified
- the offender was not charged
- the offender was found not guilty

:::note
Compensation is assessed individually. It is **not automatic**.
:::

## Who can apply?

### Victims of crime

You may be able to apply if you were the primary victim suffering injury from a criminal offence. "Injury" can include:

- physical injury
- psychological or mental harm
- pregnancy resulting from an offence

### Close relatives

A close relative may be able to apply if the victim died as a result of the offence, or if they suffered psychological harm because of what happened to the victim.

**This can be the victims:**

- Parents
- Grandparents
- Step Parents
- Spouse
- De facto partner
- Child
- Grandchild
- Step child

It is recommended to seek legal advice to determine if you qualify as an indirect victim.

:::danger
**Brothers and sisters are NOT considered close relatives under the scheme.**
:::

## What can compensation cover?

Compensation may include payment for:

- medical or psychological treatment
- the cost of medical or specialist reports
- loss of income while injured
- travel costs for treatment
- funeral expenses (for eligible close relatives)

The amount you receive will depend on the extent of your injuries and losses you have suffered. The maximum compensation that may be awarded also depends on the **date of the offence**.

<CompensationTable />
The maximum amount of compensation applies **per offence**, as long as the offences
are **unrelated**. If two or more offences are related — meaning they occurred around
the same time — they are treated as a **single offence** for compensation purposes.

:::note[Impact on Centrelink and Debts]
**Centrelink:**
Receiving criminal injuries compensation may affect your Centrelink payments. It’s important to check with Centrelink about how an award could impact your current or future benefits.

**State Debts:**
If you owe State debts (such as unpaid fines or court penalties), the Assessor may use part of your compensation to clear those debts first. Any remaining amount will then be paid to you.
:::

## Claims without a charge or conviction

A criminal injuries compensation claim can still be made even if the offender was never charged or convicted.

What matters most is whether you cooperated with police as much as you reasonably could, such as by making a report, giving information, or assisting with an investigation.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if I was unable to help the police?</strong>
  </summary>
  In some situations, a person may be unable to help police. If there were valid
  reasons for this and you can explain or support them with evidence, compensation
  may still be considered. If you are unsure how this applies to your situation,
  getting legal advice before applying may be helpful.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if I didn’t report the offence?</strong>
  </summary>
  If you did not report the offence, you may still be able to apply, but you will
  usually need a strong reason (e.g., fear, trauma). **Legal advice is strongly recommended.**
</details>

## Time limits (very important)

In most cases, you must apply within **3 years** of the date of the last offence.

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the time limit be extended?</strong></summary>

Yes. An extension may be granted for good reasons. Situations where an extension may be considered include (but are not limited to):

- the offence occurred during childhood
- living in a remote location with limited access to services or information
- mental health issues that made it difficult to prepare an application
- family, cultural, or community barriers
- other significant or exceptional circumstances

If you are considering a claim for an offence that happened **more than three years ago**, it is strongly recommended that you seek legal advice.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if the time limit is approaching?</strong>
  </summary>
  If the three-year deadline is approaching and you are not ready to lodge a full
  application, legal advice may also help you understand whether there are steps
  you can take to **protect your time limit**.
</details>

## When should I apply?

It is usually best to apply after your injuries have stabilised. If the time limit is approaching:

1. Submit the application before the deadline.
2. Include a short letter explaining that your injuries are not yet settled.

## How do I apply?

You apply by completing the appropriate application form. There are **two different forms**.

<ApplyGrid />

## Writing your statement

Your statement explains:

- what happened
- how you were injured
- how your life has been affected

There is no required format. **Clear and honest is enough.**

## Can I get money before a final decision?

In some cases, you may be able to request an **interim payment** for treatment or funeral expenses.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Important things to know about interim payments</strong>
  </summary>
  * Interim payments are part of the final compensation amount. * If your claim is
  refused, the interim payment may need to be repaid.
</details>

## Will the offender be told?

**Usually, yes.**
The offender may receive an edited copy of your application. They will **not** be given your address.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if I’m worried about my safety?</strong>
  </summary>
  You can ask the Assessor not to recover compensation from the offender by explaining
  your safety concerns in writing.
</details>

## Getting help

Legal advice is recommended if:

- the offence was not reported
- you are outside the time limit
- you suffered psychological injury
- your claim is refused or reduced
