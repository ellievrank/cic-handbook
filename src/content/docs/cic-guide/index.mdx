## What is Criminal Injuries Compensation?

Criminal Injuries Compensation is a payment that may be available if you were harmed because of a crime that happened in Western Australia.
Victims of crime who have suffered an injury can apply for compensation under the _Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 2003_ (WA).
The scheme is run by the **Office of Criminal Injuries Compensation (OCIC)**.

You may still be able to apply even if:

- the offender was never identified
- the offender was not charged
- the offender was found not guilty

:::note
Compensation is assessed individually. It is **not automatic**.
:::

## Who can apply?

### Victims of crime

You may be able to apply if you were the primary victim suffering injury from a criminal offence. "Injury" can include:

- physical injury
- psychological or mental harm
- pregnancy resulting from an offence

### Close relatives

A close relative may be able to apply if the victim died as a result of the offence, or if they suffered psychological harm because of what happened to the victim.

**This can be the victims:**

- Parents
- Grandparents
- Step Parents
- Spouse
- De facto partner
- Child
- Grandchild
- Step child

It is recommended to seek legal advice to determine if you qualify as an indirect victim.

**Brothers and sisters are NOT considered close relatives under the scheme.**
:::

## When compensation may be refused or reduced

Not every application results in compensation. Under the _Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 2003_ (WA), the Assessor may **refuse or reduce** an award in certain circumstances.

### Limited cooperation with police

Compensation may not be awarded if the applicant did not take **reasonable steps to assist police**, such as reporting the offence or helping with the investigation, unless there were valid reasons for not doing so.

### Contribution to the injury

If the applicant **contributed to their own injury**, for example by starting or escalating a physical confrontation, the Assessor may reduce the amount awarded or decline the claim entirely.

### Criminal conduct at the time of the offence

Where the applicant was **engaged in criminal activity** at the time they were injured, compensation may be refused or reduced.

### Benefit to the offender

An award may be refused if paying compensation would **directly or indirectly benefit the offender**, such as where the applicant and offender are still financially connected.

### Other compensation already received

If compensation has already been:

- awarded under this scheme,
- paid under another compensation scheme, or
- recovered through another legal process,

the Assessor may refuse the claim or limit any further payment.

In some cases, the Assessor may require another compensation option to be pursued first before deciding whether any additional (“top-up”) amount should be paid.

### Failure to meet scheme requirements

Compensation may also be affected if:

- required information or evidence is not provided, or
- directions or requests from the Assessor are not complied with.

### Discretion of the Assessor

Even where one of these factors applies, the Assessor has discretion to consider **all the circumstances** of the case. Supporting evidence and explanations can be important.

:::tip[Legal Advice Recommended]
If you are concerned that any of these situations may apply to you, seeking legal advice before lodging an application is **strongly recommended**.
:::

## What can compensation cover?

Criminal injuries compensation is not automatic for all losses. Only certain types of harm, expenses, and financial impacts can be considered. Depending on your circumstances, compensation **may include** the following:

### Injury and mental harm

- **Physical injury**, including bodily harm resulting from the offence.
- **Mental harm**, such as recognised psychological or psychiatric conditions caused by the offence. Claims for mental harm usually require medical evidence.

### Medical and treatment costs

- Costs for **medical, dental, psychological, or psychiatric treatment**, including counselling.
- Expenses related to obtaining **medical or specialist reports**.
- **Future treatment costs**, where ongoing care is likely to be needed.

### Loss of income and earning capacity

- **Income lost** because you were unable to work, including wages or paid leave used as a result of the injury.
- **Future loss of earning capacity** if the injury affects your ability to work or limits the type of work you can do.
- This can include self-employed income. Any other payments received (such as insurance) must be disclosed.

### Travel and related expenses

- **Travel costs** for attending medical or treatment appointments, including public transport or private vehicle use.

### Damage to personal property

- Repair or replacement of **personal items damaged during the offence**, such as clothing, footwear, glasses, or hearing aids.

### Loss of enjoyment of life

- Compensation for the **impact on your quality of life**, including loss of confidence or reduced ability to take part in activities you previously enjoyed (such as sport or social activities).

### Claims by close relatives

If you are a recognised **close relative** and the victim died as a result of the offence, compensation may include:

- **Loss of financial support**
- **Funeral expenses**

:::caution[Important limits]

- Compensation **cannot be claimed for legal fees** you have paid.
- All claims must be supported by evidence, such as receipts, medical reports, or other documentation.
  :::

The amount you receive will depend on the extent of your injuries and losses you have suffered. The maximum compensation that may be awarded also depends on the **date of the offence**.

<CompensationTable />
The maximum amount of compensation applies **per offence**, as long as the offences
are **unrelated**. If two or more offences are related — meaning they occurred around
the same time — they are treated as a **single offence** for compensation purposes.

:::note[Impact on Centrelink and Debts]
**Centrelink:**
Receiving criminal injuries compensation may affect your Centrelink payments. It’s important to check with Centrelink about how an award could impact your current or future benefits.

**State Debts:**
If you owe State debts (such as unpaid fines or court penalties), the Assessor may use part of your compensation to clear those debts first. Any remaining amount will then be paid to you.
:::

## Claims without a charge or conviction

A criminal injuries compensation claim can still be made even if the offender was never charged or convicted.

What matters most is whether you cooperated with police as much as you reasonably could, such as by making a report, giving information, or assisting with an investigation.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if I was unable to help the police?</strong>
  </summary>
  In some situations, a person may be unable to help police. If there were valid
  reasons for this and you can explain or support them with evidence, compensation
  may still be considered. If you are unsure how this applies to your situation,
  getting legal advice before applying may be helpful.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if I didn’t report the offence?</strong>
  </summary>
  If you did not report the offence, you may still be able to apply, but you will
  usually need a strong reason (e.g., fear, trauma). **Legal advice is strongly recommended.**
</details>

## Time limits (very important)

In most cases, you must apply within **3 years** of the date of the last offence.

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the time limit be extended?</strong></summary>

Yes. An extension may be granted for good reasons. Situations where an extension may be considered include (but are not limited to):

- the offence occurred during childhood
- living in a remote location with limited access to services or information
- mental health issues that made it difficult to prepare an application
- family, cultural, or community barriers
- other significant or exceptional circumstances

If you are considering a claim for an offence that happened **more than three years ago**, it is strongly recommended that you seek legal advice.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if the time limit is approaching?</strong>
  </summary>
  It is best to apply after your injuries have stabalised. If the three-year deadline
  is approaching and you are not ready to lodge a full application, legal advice
  may also help you understand whether there are steps you can take to **protect
  your time limit**.
</details>

## How do I apply?

You apply by completing the appropriate application form. There are **two different forms**.

## Writing your statement

Your statement explains:

- how your life has been affected

There is no required format. **Clear and honest is enough.**

## Can I get money before a final decision?

In some cases, you may be able to request an **interim payment** for treatment or funeral expenses.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Important things to know about interim payments</strong>
  </summary>
  * Interim payments are part of the final compensation amount. * If your claim is
  refused, the interim payment may need to be repaid.
</details>

## Will the offender be told?

**Usually, yes.**
The offender may receive an edited copy of your application. They will **not** be given your address.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if I’m worried about my safety?</strong>
  </summary>
  You can ask the Assessor not to recover compensation from the offender by explaining
  your safety concerns in writing.
</details>
