## What is Criminal Injuries Compensation?

Criminal Injuries Compensation is a payment that may be available if you were hurt or injured because of a crime that happened in Western Australia.
If you nhave suffered injury or harm you can apply for compensation under the _Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 2003_ (WA).
The scheme is run by the **Office of Criminal Injuries Compensation (OCIC)**.

You may still be able to apply even if the person who hurt you was:

- never identified 
- not charged 
- found not guilty depending on the grounds

## What can compensation cover?

Criminal Injuries Compensation is not automatic for all losses. Only certain types of harm, expenses and financial impacts can be considered. Depending on your circumstances, compensation **may include** the following:

### Injury and mental harm

- **Physical injury**, including bodily harm resulting from the offence.
- **Mental harm**, such as recognised psychological or psychiatric conditions caused by the offence. Claims for mental harm usually require medical evidence.

### Medical and treatment costs

- Costs for **medical, dental, psychological or psychiatric treatment**, including counselling.
- Expenses related to obtaining **medical or specialist reports**.
- **Future treatment costs**, where ongoing care is likely to be needed.

### Loss of income and earning capacity

- **Income lost** because you were unable to work, including wages or paid leave used as a result of the injury.
- **Future loss of earning capacity** if the injury affects your ability to work or limits the type of work you can do.
- This can include self-employed income. Any other payments received (such as insurance) must be disclosed.

### Travel and related expenses

- **Travel costs** for attending medical or treatment appointments, including public transport or private vehicle use.

### Damage to personal property

- Repair or replacement of **personal items damaged during the offence**, such as clothing, footwear, glasses or hearing aids.
- Items must be damaged, not stolen.

### Loss of enjoyment of life

- Compensation for the **impact on your quality of life**, including loss of confidence or reduced ability to take part in activities you previously enjoyed (such as sport or social activities).

### Claims by close relatives

If you are a recognised **close relative** and the victim died as a result of the offence, compensation may include:

- Loss of financial support
- Funeral expenses

:::caution[Important limits]

- Compensation **cannot be claimed for legal fees** you have paid.
- All claims must be supported by evidence, such as receipts, medical or health reports, or other documentation.
:::

The amount you receive may depend on the extent of your injuries and losses you have suffered. The maximum compensation that may be awarded also depends on the date of the offence:
<CompensationTable />
The maximum amount of compensation applies **per offence**, as long as the offences
are **unrelated**. If two or more offences are related — meaning they occurred around
the same time — they are treated as a **single offence** for compensation purposes.

**Please note** CIC is compensation, not a “payout”. It is meant to help cover costs and losses caused by the offence. For example medical or counselling bills, travel to appointments, lost wages or replacing damaged items. This means in most cases, you will not receive a large sum to spend freely. You will instead receive an amount that reflects what you have lost or reasonably need because of the injury.

:::note[Impact on Centrelink and Debts]
**Centrelink:**
- If paid as an economic payment - such as loss of wages - receiving Criminal Injuries Compensation may affect your Centrelink payments
- Non-economic payments, such as pain and suffering, usually do not have an effect
- **It is important to check with Centrelink about how an award could impact your current or future benefits.**

**State Debts:**
If you owe State debts - such as unpaid fines or court penalties - the Assessor may use part of your compensation to clear those debts first. Any remaining amount will then be paid to you.
:::


## Who can apply?

### Victims of crime

You can apply if you were the primary victim suffering financial loss or **injury** from a criminal offence. **"Injury"** can include:

- physical injury
- pain and suffering
- pregnancy resulting from an offence

### Close relatives

A close relative may be able to apply if:

- the victim died as a result of the offence
- they suffered because of what happened to the victim
- they have faced financial loss because of what happened to the victim

**A close relative could be a:**

- Parents
- Grandparents
- Step Parents
- Spouse
- De facto partner
- Child
- Grandchild
- Step child

:::caution[Please Note]
Brothers and sisters are not **usually** considered close relatives under the scheme. However, depending on the circumstances they may be viewed as a victim.
:::

It is recommended to seek legal advice if you are unsure about whether you qualify as a "close relative".

## When compensation may be refused or reduced

Not every application results in compensation. Under the _Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 2003_ (WA) the Assessor may **refuse or reduce** an award in certain circumstances.

### Limited cooperation with police

- Compensation may not be awarded if the applicant did not take **reasonable steps to assist police** 
- For example reporting the offence or helping with the investigation
- It may still be awarded if there were valid reasons for not cooperating with the police

### Contribution to the injury

- Compensation may be refused or reduced if the applicant **contributed to their own injury**
- For example by starting or escalating a physical confrontation

### Criminal conduct at the time of the offence

- Compensation may be refused or reduced if the applicant was **engaged in criminal activity** at the time they were injured

### Benefit to the offender

- Compensation may not be awarded if paying compensation would **directly or indirectly benefit the offender**
- For example where the applicant and offender are still financially connected

### Other compensation already received

The Assessor may refuse the claim or limit any further payment if compensation has already been:

- awarded under this scheme
- paid under another compensation scheme
- recovered through another legal process

the Assessor may refuse the claim or limit any further payment.

### Failure to meet scheme requirements

Compensation may also be affected if:

- required information or evidence is not provided
- directions or requests from the Assessor are not complied with


:::tip[Discretion of the Assessor]
Even if one of these factors apply to your situation, the Assessor will consider **all circumstances** of the case. Supporting evidence and explanations can be important. It is strongly recommended to seek legal advice in this case.
:::


<a id="claims-no-charge"></a>
## Claims without a charge or conviction
<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if I was unable to help the police?</strong>
  </summary>
  In some situations, a person may be unable to help police. If there were valid
  reasons for this and you can explain or support them with evidence, compensation
  may still be considered. If you are unsure how this applies to your situation,
  getting legal advice before applying may be helpful.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if I did not report the offence?</strong>
  </summary>
  You usually need to have reported the offence or helped the police where possible. If you were not able to do this, explain why and include any information or evidence that supports this.
</details>

## Time limits (very important)

In most cases, you must apply within **3 years** of the date of the last offence.

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the time limit be extended?</strong></summary>

Yes. Situations where an extension may be considered include (but are not limited to):

- the offence occurred during childhood
- living in a remote location with limited access to services or information
- mental health issues that made it difficult to prepare an application
- family, cultural or community barriers
- other significant or exceptional circumstances

If you are considering a claim for an offence that happened **more than three years ago**, it is recommended that you seek legal advice.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if the time limit is approaching?</strong>
  </summary>
  If the time limit is close and your injuries have not yet stabilised, you can lodge a claim before the deadline
  and include a short letter explaining that further medical information will be
  provided later. While the claim will not be assessed until the additional information
  is submitted, lodging early may avoid the need to
  apply for an extension. Legal advice may also help you understand whether there
  are steps you can take to **protect your time limit**.
</details>

## Before applying
<RecordKeeping />

## How do I apply?

You apply by completing the appropriate application form. There are **two different forms**.

### What does the application include?

A single application can cover multiple offences if they were committed by the same offender. If you were injured by more than one offender, you must submit a separate application for each offender.
These documents are usually lodged together and assessed as one application.

There is no fee to lodge an application. However, some supporting documents — such as police or medical records obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests — may involve an administration fee charged by the organisation providing the records.

**Each application generally includes:**

- the completed Application Form
- a Statement of Impact explaining what happened and how it has affected you (see below for more information)
- supporting evidence (see below for more information)

## Writing a Statement of Impact

Your statement explains:

- what happened
- how you were injured
- how your life has been affected

There is no required format. **Clear and honest is enough.**

<StatementGuide />

:::note[Important note about writing your statement]
Preparing your Statement of Impact may bring up difficult or distressing memories. It is normal to find this part of the process emotionally challenging.

If writing your statement feels overwhelming, you do not have to do it alone. You may wish to pause, take breaks or seek support from someone you trust, a counsellor or a specialist victim support service.

You can access confidential support services at any time:

:::

## Supporting evidence

You will need to provide evidence that supports your claim. This evidence helps show that the offence occurred and explains the injuries or losses you experienced as a result. What evidence is required will depend on your circumstances, but it should be relevant, clear and connected to your claim.

**Supporting evidence may include (but is not limited to):**

- police information relating to the incident
- medical or health records
- reports from treating health professionals
- photographs of injuries or property damage
- documents showing financial loss (such as lost income or expenses)
- any other relevant material that supports your application

### Accessing records (FOI)

You have the right to request access to information held about you by government agencies and other organisations under **Freedom of Information (FOI)** laws. Many organisations provide online request forms, while others may require a written request explaining what records you are seeking and the time period covered.

You will usually need to provide proof of identity when requesting records.

### Police information

Police information can help confirm that the offence was reported and provide details about what occurred. This information is usually requested directly from WA Police and may include incident reports or other relevant records.

Requests can be made online or in writing and may involve an administration fee. Processing times can vary, and it may take several weeks for information to be provided.

<details>
<summary><strong>Costs associated with police information</strong></summary>

WA Police charge an administration fee for providing information for criminal injuries compensation purposes.

- The standard fee is **$30**, but this may increase depending on the volume or type of documents requested.
- Proof of identity is required when making a request.
- Processing can take **several weeks**, particularly if investigations or court proceedings have only recently concluded.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to apply for police information</strong></summary>

Police information can be requested in one of the following ways:
- **Online:**
Applications can be made through the WA Police website:
[*Click Here to Apply for Information (WA Police)*](https://www.wa.gov.au/service/security/law-enforcement/apply-criminal-injuries-compensation-report)
- **Hard copy:**
A written application can be lodged directly with WA Police, along with proof of identity and payment of the required fee.
The information provided is commonly referred to as an **Information Report for Criminal Injuries Compensation**.
</details>

### Medical or health records

Medical or health records can show that you sought treatment following the offence. These records may come from hospitals, general practitioners, specialists, or other health services involved in your care.

Records are usually requested directly from the relevant health service through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request. FOI requests can take up to 45 days to process. It may require a written request and proof of identity. Costs may apply.

If the records are more than 20 years old, they may be held by the National Archives of Australia (NAA).

**When requesting records or reports, be clear about what information is needed and the time period covered. You may wish to ask the provider to include:**

- relevant dates of treatment
- your relevant medical history
- a description of your symptoms and diagnosis
- details of any examinations or tests performed
- how the offence contributed to your condition
- details of treatment received, including ongoing care
- medications prescribed or likely to be required
- the impact of the injury on daily life or ability to work
- your prognosis, including expected recovery or future needs

### Reports from treating health professionals

In some cases, a report from a treating doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist or other health professional may be needed to support your claim, particularly where ongoing treatment or future needs are being claimed.

Reports are best obtained from a practitioner who knows your situation. Costs for reports are not covered by Medicare, and fees can vary. Some practitioners may reduce fees or offer payment plans. This can be discussed when booking an appointment.

<details>
<summary><strong>Costs associated with medical or psychological reports</strong></summary>

Medical report fees are **not covered by Medicare**. Typical costs may include:

- **General practitioner reports:** approximately $50–$300
- **Specialist medical reports:** approximately $300–$1,500
- **Psychological or psychiatric reports:** approximately $500–$3,000

If cost is a concern, some practitioners may reduce fees, waive costs or allow payment by instalments.

</details>

### Photographs of injuries or property damage

Photographs can help demonstrate the physical impact of the offence or any damage to personal property. Where possible, photographs should be clear, dated and taken as close as practicable to the time of the incident or injury.

### Documents showing financial loss

Documents showing financial loss can include evidence of lost income, medical expenses, travel costs or other out-of-pocket expenses related to the offence. Receipts, payslips, invoices or employer letters may be used to support these claims.

### Other relevant material

Depending on your circumstances, other documents — such as insurance records or workers’ compensation information — may also be relevant and can be requested from the organisation that holds them.

## Can I get money before a final decision?

In some cases, you may be able to request an **interim payment** to help cover urgent costs before your application is finally decided. Interim payments are not automatic and must be requested.

Interim payments are generally used to help cover:

- medical or treatment expenses
- the cost of obtaining medical or psychological reports
- funeral expenses (for eligible relatives)

You can choose to pay expenses yourself and claim them later, or request an interim payment where costs cannot reasonably be met upfront. Keep all receipts, as proof of payment is required.

<details>
<summary><strong>Important things to know about interim payments</strong></summary>

- **Part of final compensation:** Interim payments are part of your final compensation and will be deducted from any amount you are ultimately awarded
- **Caps apply:** The total amount of interim payments generally cannot exceed $2,250
- **Case-by-case:** Interim payments are assessed on a case-by-case basis and are not guaranteed
- **Evidence required:** You may need to provide evidence showing why the payment is required before the final decision is made
- **Repayment risk:** If your application is refused, any interim payment received may become a **debt to the State** and must be repaid

</details>

:::tip[Seek Advice]
If you are unsure whether an interim payment is appropriate for your situation, you may wish to seek legal advice or assistance from a victim support service before applying.
:::

## Will the offender be notified?

**Usually, yes.**

In most cases, the Assessor will notify the offender that an application for Criminal Injuries Compensation has been made. This allows the offender an opportunity to respond to the claim.

The offender may receive an **edited copy** of your application. They will **not disclose your personal contact details**, such as your address.

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I am worried about my safety?</strong></summary>

If you have concerns about your safety, you can raise these with the Assessor in a section at the end of the application form. In some circumstances, the Assessor may consider requests to limit notification or recovery action against the offender.

These decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. If you are seeking to prevent the offender from being notified, it is strongly recommended that you obtain legal advice.

</details>

## After you lodge your application: what to expect

<details>
<summary><strong>How long does the process usually take?</strong></summary>

There is no set timeframe for Criminal Injuries Compensation applications.

Some matters are finalised within months, while others can take **a year or more**, particularly where additional information is required or the claim is complex.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the Assessor make a decision?</strong></summary>

An Assessor will review the information you submit, including your application form and supporting evidence. They may also consider information provided by other parties or obtained from external organisations.

The Assessor is not limited to the documents you provide and may rely on a range of relevant material when making a decision.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the Assessor request information?</strong></summary>

**Yes.** The Assessor has the power to formally request information from external organisations, such as police, government agencies or health services.

These requests are made using official notices that require the organisation to provide documents or information.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Will there be a hearing?</strong></summary>

Most applications are decided on the paperwork alone. In some cases, the Assessor may decide that a hearing is necessary.

- Hearings are **private**.
- You may be asked to attend and give evidence.
- If a hearing is required, you will be notified in advance.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I have safety concerns?</strong></summary>

If you have concerns about your safety in relation to other people involved in the process, you can inform the Assessor. Suitable arrangements can be discussed to address those concerns.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is compensation paid?</strong></summary>

If compensation is awarded, payment is made **directly to you** by the Government.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the offender challenge the decision?</strong></summary>

**Yes.** An offender has the right to appeal a compensation decision in certain circumstances.

</details>

## Can I appeal a decision?

If you are unhappy with the outcome of your application, you may be able to **appeal the decision**. This includes situations where:

- your application is refused
- you believe the amount of compensation awarded is too low

### How long do I have to appeal?

An appeal must usually be lodged within **21 days** of the date you receive the Assessor’s decision.

### Where is an appeal made?

Appeals are made to the **District Court of Western Australia**. You must lodge a notice of appeal and provide copies to the required parties.

### What happens during an appeal?

The Court will review the Assessor’s decision and the material relied upon. In some cases, the Court may:

- confirm the original decision
- vary the amount awarded
- overturn the decision entirely

You may be required to provide further information or attend a court hearing.

## Getting help

Legal advice is recommended if:

- the offence was not reported
- you are outside the time limit
- you suffered psychological injury
- your claim is refused or reduced

You may be also able to get free or low-cost assistance from community legal centres, which can help with:

 - understanding your eligibility
 - preparing or reviewing your application
 - advising on time limits, evidence and appeals

Not all services provide this assistance, and availability may depend on your circumstances and location.

If you need emotional or practical support at any stage of the process, confidential help is available.
