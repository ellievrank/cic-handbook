<InfoBox title="About This Guide">
This handbook brings together key information about criminal injuries compensation in Western Australia to help readers navigate the system with greater confidence.

It explains, in plain language, who may be eligible to apply, what compensation can cover, and where to find support during the process. The aim is to reduce confusion and help people know what questions to ask next.

This handbook does not provide legal advice. Every situation is different, and the information here may not apply to all circumstances. If you are unsure about your eligibility or rights, it is strongly recommended that you seek legal advice.

The content in this handbook has been informed by publicly available guidance from courts, government agencies, and community legal organisations. A list of resources consulted is available in the Acknowledgements section.

This handbook reflects information available at the time it was prepared in 2025. Although we are dedicated to updating information, laws, policies, and procedures may change.

## What is Criminal Injuries Compensation?

Criminal Injuries Compensation is a payment that may be available if you were harmed because of a crime that happened in Western Australia.
Victims of crime who have suffered an injury can apply for compensation under the _Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 2003_ (WA).
The scheme is run by the **Office of Criminal Injuries Compensation (OCIC)**.

You may still be able to apply even if:

- the offender was never identified
- the offender was not charged
- the offender was found not guilty

## Who can apply?

### Victims of crime

You may be able to apply if you were the primary victim suffering injury from a criminal offence. "Injury" can include:

- physical injury
- psychological or mental harm
- pregnancy resulting from an offence

### Close relatives

A close relative may be able to apply if the victim died as a result of the offence, or if they suffered psychological harm because of what happened to the victim.

**This can be the victims:**

- Parents
- Grandparents
- Step Parents
- Spouse
- De facto partner
- Child
- Grandchild
- Step child

It is recommended to seek legal advice if you are unsure of if you qualify as an indirect victim.

:::caution[Please Note]
Brothers and sisters are NOT considered close relatives under the scheme
:::

## When compensation may be refused or reduced

Not every application results in compensation. Under the _Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 2003_ (WA), the Assessor may **refuse or reduce** an award in certain circumstances.

### Limited cooperation with police

Compensation may not be awarded if the applicant did not take **reasonable steps to assist police**, such as reporting the offence or helping with the investigation, unless there were valid reasons for not doing so.

### Contribution to the injury

If the applicant **contributed to their own injury**, for example by starting or escalating a physical confrontation, the Assessor may reduce the amount awarded or decline the claim entirely.

### Criminal conduct at the time of the offence

Where the applicant was **engaged in criminal activity** at the time they were injured, compensation may be refused or reduced.

### Benefit to the offender

An award may be refused if paying compensation would **directly or indirectly benefit the offender**, such as where the applicant and offender are still financially connected.

### Other compensation already received

If compensation has already been:

- awarded under this scheme;
- paid under another compensation scheme; or
- recovered through another legal process,

the Assessor may refuse the claim or limit any further payment.

In some cases, the Assessor may require another compensation option to be pursued first before deciding whether any additional (“top-up”) amount should be paid.

### Failure to meet scheme requirements

Compensation may also be affected if:

- required information or evidence is not provided, or
- directions or requests from the Assessor are not complied with.

### Discretion of the Assessor

Even where one of these factors applies, the Assessor has discretion to consider **all the circumstances** of the case. Supporting evidence and explanations can be important.

:::tip[Legal Advice Recommended]
If you are concerned that any of these situations may apply to you, seeking legal advice before lodging an application is **strongly recommended**.
:::

## What can compensation cover?

Criminal injuries compensation is not automatic for all losses. Only certain types of harm, expenses, and financial impacts can be considered. Depending on your circumstances, compensation **may include** the following:

### Injury and mental harm

- **Physical injury**, including bodily harm resulting from the offence.
- **Mental harm**, such as recognised psychological or psychiatric conditions caused by the offence. Claims for mental harm usually require medical evidence.

### Medical and treatment costs

- Costs for **medical, dental, psychological, or psychiatric treatment**, including counselling.
- Expenses related to obtaining **medical or specialist reports**.
- **Future treatment costs**, where ongoing care is likely to be needed.

### Loss of income and earning capacity

- **Income lost** because you were unable to work, including wages or paid leave used as a result of the injury.
- **Future loss of earning capacity** if the injury affects your ability to work or limits the type of work you can do.
- This can include self-employed income. Any other payments received (such as insurance) must be disclosed.

### Travel and related expenses

- **Travel costs** for attending medical or treatment appointments, including public transport or private vehicle use.

### Damage to personal property

- Repair or replacement of **personal items damaged during the offence**, such as clothing, footwear, glasses, or hearing aids.

### Loss of enjoyment of life

- Compensation for the **impact on your quality of life**, including loss of confidence or reduced ability to take part in activities you previously enjoyed (such as sport or social activities).

### Claims by close relatives

If you are a recognised **close relative** and the victim died as a result of the offence, compensation may include:

- **Loss of financial support**
- **Funeral expenses**

:::caution[Important limits]

- Compensation **cannot be claimed for legal fees** you have paid.
- All claims must be supported by evidence, such as receipts, medical reports, or other documentation.
  :::

The amount you receive will depend on the extent of your injuries and losses you have suffered. The maximum compensation that may be awarded also depends on the **date of the offence**.

<CompensationTable />
The maximum amount of compensation applies **per offence**, as long as the offences
are **unrelated**. If two or more offences are related — meaning they occurred around
the same time — they are treated as a **single offence** for compensation purposes.

:::note[Impact on Centrelink and Debts]
**Centrelink:**
Receiving criminal injuries compensation may affect your Centrelink payments. It’s important to check with Centrelink about how an award could impact your current or future benefits.

**State Debts:**
If you owe State debts (such as unpaid fines or court penalties), the Assessor may use part of your compensation to clear those debts first. Any remaining amount will then be paid to you.
:::

## Claims without a charge or conviction

A criminal injuries compensation claim can still be made even if the offender was never charged or convicted.

What matters most is whether you cooperated with police as much as you reasonably could, such as by making a report, giving information, or assisting with an investigation.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if I was unable to help the police?</strong>
  </summary>
  In some situations, a person may be unable to help police. If there were valid
  reasons for this and you can explain or support them with evidence, compensation
  may still be considered. If you are unsure how this applies to your situation,
  getting legal advice before applying may be helpful.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if I didn’t report the offence?</strong>
  </summary>
  You need to have reported the offence to apply. It is important to note the name
  of the police officer and the report number when reporting the offence.
</details>

## Time limits (very important)

In most cases, you must apply within **3 years** of the date of the last offence.

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the time limit be extended?</strong></summary>

Yes. An extension may be granted for good reasons. Situations where an extension may be considered include (but are not limited to):

- the offence occurred during childhood
- living in a remote location with limited access to services or information
- mental health issues that made it difficult to prepare an application
- family, cultural, or community barriers
- other significant or exceptional circumstances

If you are considering a claim for an offence that happened **more than three years ago**, it is strongly recommended that you seek legal advice.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if the time limit is approaching?</strong>
  </summary>
  It is best to apply after your injuries have stabalised. If the time limit is close
  and your injuries have not yet stabilised, you can lodge a claim before the deadline
  and include a short letter explaining that further medical information will be
  provided later. While the claim will not be assessed until the additional information
  is submitted, lodging early may preserve your time limit and avoid the need to
  apply for an extension. Legal advice may also help you understand whether there
  are steps you can take to **protect your time limit**.
</details>

<RecordKeeping />

## How do I apply?

</InfoBox>

### What does the application include?

A single application can cover multiple offences if they were committed by the same offender. If you were injured by more than one offender, you must submit a separate application for each offender.
These documents are usually lodged together and assessed as one application.

There is no fee to lodge an application. However, some supporting documents — such as police or medical records obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests — may involve an administration fee charged by the organisation providing the records.

**Each application generally includes:**

- the completed Application Form
- a Statement of Impact explaining what happened and how it has affected you (_see bellow for more information_)
- supporting evidence (_see bellow for more information_)

## Writing a Statement of Impact

Your statement explains:

- what happened
- how you were injured
- how your life has been affected

There is no required format. **Clear and honest is enough.**

<StatementGuide />

:::note[Important note about writing your statement]
Preparing your Personal Statement may bring up difficult or distressing memories. It is normal to find this part of the process emotionally challenging.

If writing your statement feels overwhelming, you do not have to do it alone. You may wish to pause, take breaks, or seek support from someone you trust, a counsellor, or a specialist victim support service.

You can access confidential support services at any time:

:::

## Supporting evidence

You will need to provide evidence that supports your claim. This evidence helps show that the offence occurred and explains the injuries or losses you experienced as a result. What evidence is required will depend on your circumstances, but it should be relevant, clear, and connected to your claim.

### Accessing records (FOI)

You have the right to request access to information held about you by government agencies and other organisations under **Freedom of Information (FOI)** laws. Many organisations provide online request forms, while others may require a written request explaining what records you are seeking and the time period covered.

You will usually need to provide proof of identity when requesting records.

**Supporting evidence may include (but is not limited to):**

- police information relating to the incident
- medical or health records
- reports from treating health professionals
- photographs of injuries or property damage
- documents showing financial loss (such as lost income or expenses)
- any other relevant material that supports your application

### Police information

Police information can help confirm that the offence was reported and provide details about what occurred. This information is usually requested directly from WA Police and may include incident reports or other relevant records.

Requests can be made online or in writing and may involve an administration fee. Processing times can vary, and it may take several weeks for information to be provided.

<details>
<summary><strong>Costs associated with police information</strong></summary>

WA Police charge an administration fee for providing information for criminal injuries compensation purposes.

- The standard fee is **approximately $30**, but this may increase depending on the volume or type of documents requested.
- Proof of identity is required when making a request.
- Processing can take **several weeks**, particularly if investigations or court proceedings have only recently concluded.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to apply for police information</strong></summary>

Police information can be requested in one of the following ways:

**Online:**
Applications can be made through the WA Police website:
👉 [Apply for Information (WA Police)](https://www.police.wa.gov.au/Police-Direct/Apply-for-Information)

**Hard copy:**
A written application can be lodged directly with WA Police, along with proof of identity and payment of the required fee.

The information provided is commonly referred to as an **Information Report for Criminal Injuries Compensation**.

</details>

### Medical or health records

Medical or health records can show that you sought treatment following the offence. These records may come from hospitals, general practitioners, specialists, or other health services involved in your care.

Records are usually requested directly from the relevant health service and may require a written request and proof of identity.

When requesting records or reports, it is best to be clear about what information is needed and the time period covered. You may wish to ask the provider to include:

- relevant dates of treatment
- your relevant medical history
- a description of your symptoms and diagnosis
- details of any examinations or tests performed
- how the offence contributed to your condition
- details of treatment received, including ongoing care
- medications prescribed or likely to be required
- the impact of the injury on daily life or ability to work
- your prognosis, including expected recovery or future needs

### Reports from treating health professionals

In some cases, a report from a treating doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist, or other health professional may be needed to support your claim, particularly where ongoing treatment or future needs are being claimed.

Reports are best obtained from a practitioner who knows your situation. Costs for reports are not covered by Medicare, and fees can vary. Some practitioners may reduce fees or offer payment plans—this can be discussed when booking an appointment.

:::note[Interim Payments]
Interim payments may be available in limited circumstances to help cover certain costs before a final decision is made. If an application is unsuccessful, any interim payment may need to be repaid.
:::

<details>
<summary><strong>Costs associated with medical or psychological reports</strong></summary>

Medical report fees are **not covered by Medicare**. Typical costs may include:

- **General practitioner reports:** approximately $50–$300
- **Specialist medical reports:** approximately $300–$1,500
- **Psychological or psychiatric reports:** approximately $500–$3,000

If cost is a concern, some practitioners may reduce fees, waive costs, or allow payment by instalments.

</details>

### Photographs of injuries or property damage

Photographs can help demonstrate the physical impact of the offence or any damage to personal property. Where possible, photographs should be clear, dated, and taken as close as practicable to the time of the incident or injury.

### Documents showing financial loss

Documents showing financial loss can include evidence of lost income, medical expenses, travel costs, or other out-of-pocket expenses related to the offence. Receipts, payslips, invoices, or employer letters may be used to support these claims.

### Other relevant material

Depending on your circumstances, other documents—such as insurance records or workers’ compensation information—may also be relevant and can be requested from the organisation that holds them.

## Can I get money before a final decision?

In some cases, you may be able to request an **interim payment** to help cover urgent costs before your application is finally decided. Interim payments are not automatic and must be requested.

Interim payments are generally used to help cover:

- medical or treatment expenses
- the cost of obtaining medical or psychological reports
- funeral expenses (for eligible relatives)

You can choose to pay expenses yourself and claim them later, or request an interim payment where costs cannot reasonably be met upfront. Keep all receipts, as proof of payment is required.

<details>
<summary><strong>Important things to know about interim payments</strong></summary>

- **Part of final compensation:** Interim payments are part of your final compensation and will be deducted from any amount you are ultimately awarded.
- **Caps apply:** The total amount of interim payments generally cannot exceed **3% of the maximum compensation** that could be awarded in your case (approx. $2,250).
- **Case-by-case:** Interim payments are assessed on a case-by-case basis and are not guaranteed.
- **Evidence required:** You may need to provide evidence showing why the payment is required before the final decision is made.
- **Repayment risk:** If your application is refused, any interim payment received may become a **debt to the State** and must be repaid.

</details>

:::tip[Seek Advice]
If you’re unsure whether an interim payment is appropriate for your situation, you may wish to seek legal advice or assistance from a victim support service before applying.
:::

## Will the offender be notified?

**Usually, yes.**

In most cases, the Assessor will notify the offender that an application for criminal injuries compensation has been made. This allows the offender an opportunity to respond to the claim.

The offender may receive an **edited copy** of your application. Your **personal contact details**, such as your address, are not disclosed.

Notification is generally limited to offences where the offender was **charged or convicted**, but this will depend on the circumstances of the case.

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I’m worried about my safety?</strong></summary>

If you have concerns about your safety, you can raise these with the Assessor in writing. In some circumstances, the Assessor may consider requests to limit notification or recovery action against the offender.

These decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. If you are seeking to prevent the offender from being notified, it is strongly recommended that you obtain legal advice.

</details>

## After you lodge your application: what to expect

<details>
<summary><strong>How long does the process usually take?</strong></summary>

There is no set timeframe for criminal injuries compensation applications.

Some matters are finalised within months, while others can take **a year or more**, particularly where additional information is required or the claim is complex.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the Assessor make a decision?</strong></summary>

An Assessor will review the information you submit, including your application form and supporting evidence. They may also consider information provided by other parties or obtained from external organisations.

The Assessor is not limited to the documents you provide and may rely on a range of relevant material when making a decision.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the Assessor request more information?</strong></summary>

**Yes.** The Assessor has the power to formally request information from external organisations, such as police, government agencies, or health services.

These requests are made using official notices that require the organisation to provide documents or information.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Will there be a hearing?</strong></summary>

Most applications are decided on the paperwork alone. In some cases, the Assessor may decide that a hearing is necessary.

- Hearings are **private**.
- You may be asked to attend and give evidence.
- If a hearing is required, you will be notified in advance.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I have safety concerns?</strong></summary>

If you have concerns about your safety in relation to other people involved in the process, you can inform the Assessor. Suitable arrangements can be discussed to address those concerns.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is compensation paid?</strong></summary>

If compensation is awarded, payment is made **directly to you** by the Government.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the offender challenge the decision?</strong></summary>

**Yes.** An offender has the right to appeal a compensation decision in certain circumstances.

</details>

## Can I appeal a decision?

If you are unhappy with the outcome of your application, you may be able to **appeal the decision**. This includes situations where:

- your application is refused, or
- you believe the amount of compensation awarded is too low.

### How long do I have to appeal?

An appeal must usually be lodged within **21 days** of the date you receive the Assessor’s decision.

### Where is an appeal made?

Appeals are made to the **District Court of Western Australia**. You must lodge a notice of appeal and provide copies to the required parties.

### What happens during an appeal?

The Court will review the Assessor’s decision and the material relied upon. In some cases, the Court may:

- confirm the original decision,
- vary the amount awarded, or
- overturn the decision entirely.

You may be required to provide further information or attend a court hearing.

## Getting help

Legal advice is recommended if:

- the offence was not reported
- you are outside the time limit
- you suffered psychological injury
- your claim is refused or reduced

You may be also able to get free or low-cost assistance from community legal centres, which can help with:

 - understanding your eligibility
 - preparing or reviewing your application
 - advising on time limits, evidence, and appeals

Not all services provide this assistance, and availability may depend on your circumstances and location.

If you need emotional or practical support at any stage of the process, confidential help is available.
