## What is Criminal Injuries Compensation?

Criminal Injuries Compensation is a payment that may be available if you were harmed because of a crime that happened in Western Australia.

The scheme is run by the **Office of Criminal Injuries Compensation (OCIC)**.

You may still be able to apply even if:

- the offender was never identified
- the offender was not charged
- the offender was found not guilty

:::note
Compensation is assessed individually. It is **not automatic**.
:::

## Who can apply?

### Victims of crime

You may be able to apply if you were injured because of a criminal offence. "Injury" can include:

- physical injury
- psychological or mental harm
- pregnancy resulting from an offence

### Close relatives

A close relative may be able to apply if the victim died as a result of the offence, or if they suffered psychological harm because of what happened to the victim.

A close relative can include:

- a parent, grandparent, or step-parent
- a spouse or de facto partner
- a child, grandchild, or step-child

:::danger
**Brothers and sisters are NOT considered close relatives under the scheme.**
:::

## What can compensation cover?

Compensation may include payment for:

- medical or psychological treatment
- the cost of medical or specialist reports
- loss of income while injured
- travel costs for treatment
- clothing damaged during the offence
- funeral expenses (for eligible close relatives)

You usually need proof, such as receipts or reports.

## Do I need to report the crime to police?

**In most cases, yes.**

You are expected to report the offence to police as soon as reasonably possible and assist police where you can.

Even if no one is charged or convicted, you may still be able to apply. When reporting, it helps to keep the **police report number** and the **name of the officer**.

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I didn’t report the offence?</strong></summary>
If you did not report the offence, you may still be able to apply, but you will usually need a strong reason. This might include fear, trauma, or safety concerns.

**Legal advice is strongly recommended in this situation.**

</details>

## Time limits (very important)

In most cases, you must apply within **3 years** of:

- the date of the offence, or
- the date of the last offence if there were multiple incidents by the same offender

The time limit applies even if you were a child at the time.

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the time limit be extended?</strong></summary>
Yes, sometimes. An extension may be granted if there is a good reason for the delay, such as childhood abuse, mental health impacts, or lack of access to information.

If you are outside the time limit, get legal advice as soon as possible.

</details>

## When should I apply?

It is usually best to apply after your injuries have stabilised.

If the time limit is approaching and your injuries are ongoing:

1. Submit the application before the deadline.
2. Include a short letter explaining that your injuries are not yet settled.

This can protect your right to claim later.

## How do I apply?

You apply by completing the appropriate application form and lodging it with the Office of Criminal Injuries Compensation. There are **two different forms**.

## Writing your statement

Your statement explains:

- what happened
- how you were injured
- how your life has been affected

This can include changes to work, relationships, daily functioning, and emotional wellbeing. You can use your police statement as a starting point. There is no required format. **Clear and honest is enough.**

## Can I get money before a final decision?

In some cases, you may be able to request an **interim payment**. This may help cover medical treatment, reports, or funeral expenses.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Important things to know about interim payments</strong>
  </summary>
  * Interim payments are part of the final compensation amount. * If your claim is
  refused, the interim payment may need to be repaid. * Legal advice is recommended
  before requesting one.
</details>

## Will the offender be told?

**Usually, yes.**

The offender may receive an edited copy of your application and relevant medical reports. They will **not** be given your address.

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What if I’m worried about my safety?</strong>
  </summary>
  You can ask the Assessor not to recover compensation from the offender. You will
  need to explain your safety concerns in writing. The Assessor will decide whether
  recovery is appropriate.
</details>

## Getting help

This process can be emotionally difficult. Legal advice is recommended if:

- the offence was not reported
- you are outside the time limit
- you suffered psychological injury
- you are a close relative
- your claim is refused or reduced
