# CIC Handbook

_A clear, trauma-informed guide to Criminal Injuries Compensation in Australia_

## Overview

**CIC Handbook** is a free, non-profit information project designed to help victims of crime understand **Criminal Injuries Compensation (CIC)** in Australia — starting with **Western Australia**.
